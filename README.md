# Predicting_Ore_Quality

## Goal

- To predict final % concentrate of iron (ore) or silica (waste) ahead of time using time-series analysis which will allow engineers to maximize recovery while miniming tailings and decreasing costs. 
- The typical flotation process can take 1-2 days. Being able to predict the final product before the process starts allows for feed-forward optimization.

## Dataset
